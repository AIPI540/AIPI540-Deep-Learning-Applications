# Computer vision
This directory contains notebooks which introduce several of the foundational approaches and architectures used to solve problems in computer vision.  This content accompanies the Computer Vision module of the course.  These notebooks should be run on GPU.  

The directory contains the following demo notebooks (which should be reviewed in order):  
- **CNNs**  
    - **cnn_basics**  
        - introduces the use of convolutional neural networks for image classification  
    - **cnn_w_tensorboard**  
        - demonstrates the use of TensorBoard with PyTorch to track and visualize metrics on the model training and performance  
    - **simple_resnet**  
        - introduces the ResNet skip-connection and how to develop a custom ResNet model in PyTorch
    - **transfer_learning**  
        - demonstrates how to use pre-trained models and conduct fine tune training for image classification problems  
    - **xrays_example**  
        - example of how to create a custom PyTorch Dataset to load images and labels stored in non-standard formats and how to work with medical DICOM files


- **object_detection**  
    - **YOLO**  
        - demonstrates use of YOLO using a pre-trained model for object detection on images and webcam capture
    - **Detectron2**  
        - demo of object detection, keypoint prediction and image segmentation using the Detectron2 model
