# Neural network basics
This directory contains notebooks which demonstrate the creation and use of simple fully connected neural networks.  This content accompanies the Week 1 lecture. 

The notebook contents are as follows:  
- **neural_networks_from_scratch**  
    - implementations of shallow neural networks in Python & NumPy for regression and classification tasks  
- **pytorch_nn_intro**  
    - demo examples of creating, training and evaluating neural networks using PyTorch  
- **tensorflow_nn_intro**  
    - demo examples of creating, training and evaluating neural networks using TensorFlow 
- **training_techniques**  
    - introduces several methods to speed up training of neural networks and/or reduce overfitting risk
